- Modal dialogs: max-w-sm (focused result display)

### D. Component Library

**Home Screen Components:**
- Gradient hero section with game title (h-screen flex centered)
- Nickname input: Large text field with dark surface bg-[220 18% 15%], blue focus ring, rounded-xl

- Status text: Fixed top position showing "Your Turn" or "Opponent's Turn"

**Winning Line Animation:**
- Diagonal/Horizontal/Vertical overlay using absolute positioning
- Gradient stroke from blue to pink (4px width)

- Animated pulsing dots or spinner
- Share button with clipboard functionality
- "Waiting for opponent..." message with loading animation

**Disconnect Notification:**
- Toast/banner at top: bg-red-600 text-white with "Opponent disconnected" message
- Auto-return to home option after 5 seconds

### E. Animations & Interactions

**Framer Motion Animations:**
- Page transitions: Fade + slide up (y: 20 to 0)
- Cell placement: Scale spring animation (0 to 1.2 to 1) with 0.3s duration
- X/O appearance: Rotate + scale-in with color fade
- Win celebration: Winning line draws in 0.5s, confetti bursts for 3s
- Button hover: Scale 1.02 with shadow increase
- Modal entry: Scale 0.95 to 1 with fade-in

**No Animation Zones:**
- Turn indicator updates (instant)
- Room code copy (instant feedback only)
- Disable animations on rematch for faster restart

### F. Responsive Behavior
- Mobile (< 768px): Single column, smaller cells (w-16 h-16), text-5xl markers
- Tablet/Desktop (â‰¥ 768px): Larger board, text-7xl markers, side-by-side player info
- Touch targets: Minimum 44x44px for mobile cells
- Viewport: Game board always visible without scrolling on common devices

### G. Key UX Patterns
- **Feedback:** Every action has immediate visual/haptic response
- **State Clarity:** Current turn always visible with glowing indicator
- **Error Prevention:** Disable filled cells, show validation messages
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Room code generation visible step-by-step
- **Micro-interactions:** Button press ripples, input field focus rings, copy success checkmark

### H. Images
**No hero images required** - This is a functional game application where the game board itself is the visual centerpiece. Use gradient backgrounds and animated elements instead of static images.
